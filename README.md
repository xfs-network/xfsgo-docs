# What is XFS?

XFS (X File System) is a new, powerful and efficient cloud storage platform. It stores files on the internet by P2P (peer to peer) network with high level of availability & security However, XFS itself only records the storage contracts users write other than data assets that will be stored in a distributed file system.  XFS is targeting multiple implementations of the protocol in order to guarantee security but also resilience of the XFS-Network.&#x20;

### Overview

XFS makes difference with the following features:

#### High performance

There are many optimizations to storage proof and space-time proof algorithms required for distributed file storage.that XFS has implemented.which improves XFS performance and avoided waste of resources greatly.

#### High Security

We are okay with higher degrees of risk if a risk-increasing change provides very substantial benefits (eg. generalized state transitions, faster block times, consensus efficiency, etc). Although XFS  borrows many ideas that have already been tried and tested for several years in older blockchain like Bitcoin, there are a number of places in which XFS diverges from the most common way of handling certain protocol features, and there are also many situations in which XFS has been forced to develop completely new storage approaches because it offers functionality that is not offered by other existing systems, especially in encryption algorithms.

#### XVM

XFS is a distributed state machine from point of clients. XFS's state is a large data structure which holds not only all accounts and balances, but a machine state, which can change from block to block according to a pre-defined set of rules, and which can execute arbitrary machine code. The specific rules of changing state from block to block are defined by the XVM. by which XFS smart contracts that defined by clients according  to scenarios can be executed to implement all kinds of requirements.

#### Simplicity

We believe that the bottom level architecture of XFS should be as simple as possible, and the interfaces to XFS (including high level programming languages for developers and the user interface for users) should be as easy to understand as possible. Where complexity is inevitable, it should be pushed into the "middle layers" of the protocol, that are not part of the core consensus but are also not seen by end users, argument serialization and deserialization scripts, storage data structure models, the  badger storage interface and the wire protocol, etc.

#### Scalability & Extensibility

XFS smart contracts are extremely flexible, capable of both holding large quantities of tokens and running immutable logic based on previously deployed smart contract code. It is also the perfect ecosystem to attract attackers looking to profit by exploiting vulnerabilities in smart contracts and unexpected behavior in XFS. Apart from that. you also can develop applications  instead of file storage by XFS, for example, different kinds of DAPPs.
